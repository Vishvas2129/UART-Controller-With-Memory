# UART-Controller-With-Memory

# UART Controller with Memory
This project is a Verilog implementation of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) controller with a memory buffer. It is designed to facilitate serial communication between a microcontroller or FPGA and external devices using the UART protocol, with support for data buffering.

# Features
Configurable Baud Rate: The baud rate for serial communication can be adjusted according to the desired speed.
Memory Buffer: Supports storing incoming and outgoing data in a memory buffer, making it suitable for applications that require data storage or queuing.
Configurable Memory Depth: The memory buffer depth can be adjusted, enabling customization based on application requirements.
Full-Duplex Communication: Supports simultaneous transmission and reception of data.
Error Detection: Includes error checking for common UART communication issues, such as parity errors and framing errors.
Parameterizable Design: Allows configuration of various UART parameters (e.g., baud rate, data bits, stop bits) via Verilog parameters.

# Design Overview
The design consists of two primary modules:
# UART Transmitter: 
Handles the transmission of data from the memory buffer to the UART serial output.
# UART Receiver:
Receives incoming data from the UART serial input and stores it in the memory buffer.

# Configuring the UART Controller
The UART controller can be customized using various parameters:

BAUD_RATE: Set the desired baud rate for UART communication.
DATA_BITS: Configure the number of data bits (e.g., 8 bits).
STOP_BITS: Set the number of stop bits (e.g., 1 or 2).
PARITY: Optionally enable parity checking (even/odd/none).
MEMORY_DEPTH: Specify the depth of the memory buffer.

# Usage
Instantiation: Integrate the UART controller module into your Verilog project.
Parameter Configuration: Customize the UART parameters to match the requirements of your application.
Simulate or Implement: Use a simulation tool to verify the functionality, or synthesize the design on an FPGA.

# Applications
Embedded systems with serial communication requirements.
Interfacing microcontrollers or FPGA boards with sensors, actuators, or other peripherals.
Data logging applications requiring buffered serial data.

#Future Enhancements
Flow Control: Add support for hardware flow control (RTS/CTS).
Interrupt Handling: Enable interrupt-driven data handling for efficient processing.
DMA Integration: Interface with a Direct Memory Access (DMA) controller for high-speed data transfers.
